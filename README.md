This is a sweet collection of my Blender files.

My projects contain beautiful textures, so when you open these files, make sure to choose the final viewport shading mode.

How to Open the Files:

1. Install Blender:

Make sure that you have Blender installed. If not, download and install Blender from blender.org.

2. Download the file and launch Blender.

3. Go to File > Open and select the .blend file.

4. Switch to the final viewport shading mode (Rendered) to view the project with all textures.

You can find some kind of "balls" at the top right of the interface; select the last one (4) to enable the rendered view.

5. Hope you will like it! ♡ (≧◡≦) ♡
